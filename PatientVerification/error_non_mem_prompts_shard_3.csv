"Upper lobe predominant interstitial lung disease, which could be
 due to chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis or (if the patient is a smoker)
 smoking-related interstitial lung disease."
"Feeding tube ends in the upper stomach.  Extremely large right pleural
 effusion is stable since ___:17 on ___, shifting the mediastinum
 markedly to the left. Lungs are grossly clear.  Right jugular dialysis
 catheter ends in the upper right atrium.  Left jugular line ends in the low
 SVC.  No pneumothorax."
Slightly improved mild pulmonary edema.
"Suspect mild CHF.
 
 Status post removal of right chest tube.  No pneumothorax or gross effusion
 identified.
 
 Bibasilar patchy opacities, presumably atelectasis, again noted, similar to
 prior."
"Tracheostomy projects over midline. Bibasilar atelectasis with possible mild
 edema."
New left lower lobe parenchymal opacity is suspicious for pneumonia.
"Compared to chest radiographs moderate cardiomegaly stable.  Mediastinal veins
 dilated, unchanged.  No pulmonary edema or pleural effusion. Right jugular
 line passes as far as the mid SVC.  Atrial biventricular pacer defibrillator
 leads in standard placements unchanged.  No pneumothorax."
"In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with engorgement of indistinct pulmonary vessels,
 consistent with developing pulmonary edema. The appearance is similar to the
 CTA of the chest performed previously."
"Comparison to ___.  All monitoring and support devices, except for
 the right internal jugular vein catheter, have been removed.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly and bilateral
 areas of basilar atelectasis.  No pneumonia."
"In comparison with the study of ___, there again is a linear scar
 in the right upper lobe, which could possibly relate to old tuberculous
 disease.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease."
"Mild hazy opacity in the retrocardiac region, question due to atelectasis,
 though an early infectious infiltrate or area of aspiration pneumonitis could
 have a similar appearance.   If clinically indicated, a lateral view could
 help for further characterization.
 
 Otherwise, no acute pulmonary process identified."
New right central line at the cavoatrial junction or upper right atrium.
Normal postoperative appearance of the left lung. No pneumothorax.
"In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is an placement of a
 nasogastric tube that extends to the lower body of the stomach with the side
 port clearly distal to the esophagogastric junction.  Little overall change in
 the appearance of the heart and lungs."
"1) No acute findings
 2) Stable interstitial lung disease."
